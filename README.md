# 2D Game Level

A simple 2D game built using Pygame.  Navigate a maze, collect items, and avoid enemies!

## Gameplay

The goal is to collect all the items ('I') scattered throughout the level while avoiding enemies.  Use the W, A, S, D keys to move.  Colliding with an enemy reduces your health.  The game ends if your health reaches zero.  Complete levels to progress.
